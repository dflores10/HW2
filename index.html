<h2><a id="about"></a> About Me </h2>
<p> I am from Downers Grove, Illinois, a western suburb of Chicago. For those familiar with the area I also attended Downers Grove South High School. I come from
	a pretty big family but my immediate family consists of my parents and three older brothers. I also have two nephews, one of which is my godson. For the most
	part my entire extended family lives in Illinois so we tend to spend a lot of time together, which I absolutely love. </p>
	
<p> Currently, I am a Senior double majoring in Accounting and MIS. I am also part of the accounting organization, Beta Alpha Psi. Along with being a full time 
	student I work remotely for McDonald's Corporation as a Consultant in the US IT Department. My future planes include going to graduate school for my
	Masters of Accountancy either at Iowa, Texas, Florida, Arizona or California. If I am able to I'd prefer to get out of the mid-west for graduate school
	to experience something different. After I get my Masters Degree I would like to get certified to become a Public Accountant, Information Systems Auditor and
	an Internal Auditor. Ideally, I would love to live in Wrigleyville (Chicago) once I am done with school.</p>

<p> When I have free time I enjoy doing a variety of things. However, my all time favorite things to do include hanging out with my nephews, listening to music,
	traveling, running, shopping at Costco and watching the Chicago Bulls. The most interesting thing I have done during my free time was participating in a service 
	learning project called The Xicotepec Project for two years in a row and took place in Xicotepec, Mexico. </p>
